# Jellyfin Ansible role
This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

## Installing
To configure and install Jellyfin on your own server(s) with this role, you should use a playbook
like [Mother of all self-hosting](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) or
write your own.
